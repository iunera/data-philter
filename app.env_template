# IUNERA_MODEL_TYPE
#
# Specifies the AI model to be used by the application, based on the Aura model tier system.
# Each tier is fine-tuned for specific use cases, from complex reasoning to simple pattern-matching.
#
# Possible values are:
#
#   - "ollama-s" (Small Tier) The Reliable Agent:
#     - Model: iunera/aura-s (based on Microsoft Phi-4-mini, 3.8B parameters)

#     - Use Case: Your primary "workhorse" model for complex, multi-step tasks and conversations that require chat history context.
#     - Requires: A GPU-based system or a Macbook with an M-series chip and at least 8GB of memory.
#     - Details: https://ollama.com/iunera/aura-m

#
#   - "ollama-xl" (Extra Large Model):
#     - Uses the gpt-oss:20b model.
#     - Recommended for heavy workloads and advanced reasoning on capable hardware.
#     - Recommended on a Macbook with an Apple M‑series chip and at least 64GB of unified memory (or strong GPU setup).
#
#   - "openai" (OpenAI Model):
#     - Uses the OpenAI API to access their models.
#     - Requires an OpenAI API key to be set in the SPRING_AI_OPENAI_API_KEY variable.
